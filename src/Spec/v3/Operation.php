     * The documentation is not necessarily expected to cover all possible HTTP response codes because they may not be
     * known in advance. However, documentation is expected to cover a successful operation response and any known
     * errors. The "default" code MAY be used as a default response object for all HTTP codes that are not covered
     * individually by the specification.
     *
     * The Responses Object MUST contain at least one response code, and it SHOULD be the response for a successful
     * operation call.
     *
     * Any HTTP status code can be used as the property name, but only one property per code, to describe the
     * expected response for that HTTP status code. A Reference Object can link to a response that is defined in the
     * OpenAPI Object's components/responses section. This field MUST be enclosed in quotation marks (for example,
     * "200") for compatibility between JSON and YAML. To define a range of response codes, this field MAY contain the
     * uppercase wildcard character X. For example, 2XX represents all response codes between [200-299]. The following
     * range definitions are allowed: 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, and 5XX. If a response range is defined using an explicit
     * code, the explicit code definition takes precedence over the range definition for that code.
